# Greed-not-Green-Database

The gng-construct.sql file shows the commands that I used to create the tables and insert into the database.

The gng-model-main.pdf shows my entity relationship diagram for my database.

The gng_relations.md file shows the relations that I used for my database.

The gng_dump.sql shows the result of running the pg_dump command on my database.

The gng.py file lets you access some of the data within the database as well as insert some data into the database. When you first run the program you will be faced with the main menu and the instructions will let you know what your options are for commands that you can enter.
